# E-Mail/SMS Spam Classifier

![Project Preview](./resources/1.png)

Welcome to the SMS Spam Detection project! This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). We use a dataset containing labeled SMS messages for training and evaluation.

## Project Overview

SMS spam is a common issue that affects mobile phone users. The goal of this project is to develop a robust SMS spam detection model that can automatically classify incoming text messages as spam or not. We leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **dataset**: This folder contains the dataset used, named "spam.csv."
- **resources**: This folder includes images and other files related to the project.
- **.gitignore**: Gitignore file to specify which files or directories should be ignored in version control.
- **AboutTheCode.md**: Detailed explanation of the code and its components.
- **app.py**: A Streamlit web app to host the model locally for interactive testing.
- **code.txt**: A backup text file containing the code used in the project.
- **model.pkl**: Serialized machine learning model for SMS spam detection.
- **vectorizer.pkl**: Serialized feature vectorizer (TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer) used for text data.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python packages and dependencies required to run the project.
- **nltk.txt**: Text file containing NLTK library imports, including stopwords and punkt.
- **spam-detection.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook source file containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sms-spam-detection
```

3. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS and Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Explore the Jupyter Notebook (`spam-detection.ipynb`) for in-depth details on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

7. To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a local web app for SMS spam detection.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). It contains SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham." You can download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the "dataset" folder.

## About the Code

For detailed information about the code and its components, please refer to the [AboutTheCode.md](./AboutTheCode.md) file in this repository.

## Roadmap

The project roadmap includes the following tasks:

- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Feature engineering using text vectorization techniques.
- Model selection and training.
- Model evaluation and performance analysis.
- Streamlit app development for interactive testing.
- Documentation and code explanation.
